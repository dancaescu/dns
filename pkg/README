Packaging helpers are split by platform:

  * redhat/   – legacy RPM spec files and automake glue (moved from the old pkg/ root).
  * debian/   – Debian helpers and scripts.

See redhat/README for details on building RPMs.  The debian directory now
contains a simple build script that wraps dpkg-buildpackage.
